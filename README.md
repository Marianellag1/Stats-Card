## My process
I really like setting up all file and folders up. Looking through what is required and start forming an idea of how I can start the challenge. As well as having side by side vs code with browser to visually see how the challenge is looking.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Ever since learning about bootstrap, I have tried to do almost all challenges with that framework. It's super helpful, but I have wanted 
to for some time try to make my own columns and css without the help of bootstrap. I think I did a pretty good job. I am still learning and
figuring out all the syntax and how it works and may go along, but this all in all was a great accomplishment for me.

### Continued development

As the user can see, I couldn't make the image with the violet tint. I will have to do more research on that, as well as how I can format challenge into different screen sizes, so viewers can get full experience on any device.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools is very helpful when it comes to allowing me to visually see codes that I can implement on my own code, and try it out before putting it on my code.
- [resource 2](https://www.google.com) - I searched too many sites, but google was there for me to give me the most revelant help I needed, even if what I put in search made no sense.
